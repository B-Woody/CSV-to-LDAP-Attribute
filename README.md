# CSV-to-LDAP-Attribute

I wrote this to automate a tedious admin task. I'm new to GitHub and I have very little scripting/coding experience.
I'm sure there are many more efficient ways that this script could be written and I welcome any feedback.

A staff phone directory intranet page pulls phone numbers from LDAP attributes of user accounts.
In the past phone number changes were given to us in a spreadsheet and manually updated one by one with a GUI tool.
This script pulls the numbers and usernames from a CSV file and updates LDAP in bulk.
